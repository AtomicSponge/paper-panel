I started this as I was interested in Vue SSR and wanted to play around with some of the newer tools to get a hang of them.  Well I did and now I see this as more work than a fun engaging challenge to learn from, and I'm not really sure just how useful a tool like this is really anyway. :sweat_smile:  So here it is, if anyone else wants to continue this.  But otherwise I'm retiring this for now.  I want to focus on my game engine when I have the time again.

<table align="center">

  <td><img src="./assets/logo/paper-panel-logo-512-512.png" width="64"/></td>
  <td><h1>Paper Panel<h1></td>

<tr>
  <td colspan="2">
    <h3>Control Panel Software for the <a href="https://papermc.io/software/paper">Paper MC</a> Server</h3>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

This is still a work in progress.

Current set of features are:
- First-run configuration
- Ability to edit server YAML configuration files
- Ability to edit world YAML configuration files
- Update the server to latest build or version

Items in progress:
- Ability to edit player JSON configuration files
- Ability to import and export worlds
- Implement authentication & user management
- Documentation & configuration steps ([wiki](https://github.com/AtomicSponge/paper-panel/wiki))
- Plugin support (at minimum add/remove ability)
